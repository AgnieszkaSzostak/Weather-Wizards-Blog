## :small_orange_diamond: About project:
I've created a cool blog for weather enthusiasts using a headless CMS called Prismic. 

Prismic is a headless CMS tool that enables you to create, edit, and publish content without the need to touch your website's code. It works as an independent backend that stores the content and allows its distribution across various channels. In other words, with Prismic, I could have focus on creating and managing content, while leaving the technical aspects of content delivery to the CMS.

To make things even better, I've used OpenAI's chatgpt to generate the blog posts, which are fetched via API. And of course, I've made sure to set up user-friendly URLs to provide a great user experience!
